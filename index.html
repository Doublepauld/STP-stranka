        <h2 id="about-us">About us</h2>
        <p>
            We are a group of students from Czech Republic that decided to make our first game.
            This project gave us important knowledge and insight into the game development world.
            We also gained skills in some parts of game development we have never done for example : random generation, design of the world and enemies and finally Teamwork in a small team.
